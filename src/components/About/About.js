              As a Full Stack Developer, I have completed a comprehensive course
              and acquired expertise in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js,
              SQL, and Agile Methodology. My skills in SDLC enable me to build
              responsive user interfaces, efficient back-end solutions, and
